                <p>Since 1999, SNOWBOARDER Magazine has honored professional snowboarding’s best with our Top Ten Rider of the Year Awards. What lends this title such acclaim is the fact that it is solely based upon the discretion and opinions of professional snowboarding’s most elite club, those riders who have themselves appeared on our Top Ten Rider of the Year list. This means that when a pro receives this accolade they do so by impressing the likes of Pat Moore, Mark McMorris, Travis Parker, Gigi Rüf, Jeremy Jones, Marie-France Roy, Louif Paradis and more.<br><br>

                At its core, this ranking is intended to celebrate the riders who were the most exceptional professional snowboarders from December 1st, 2014 to November 31st, 2015. These riders are recognized for the fundamental responsibilities of being a professional snowboarder. This is based strictly upon the amount and quality of video parts, contest results and magazine coverage with an emphasis on diversity of terrain and discipline variance. Ideally, this process brings us to the individuals who most influenced the progression of snowboarding on a consistent basis over the course of this past season.<br><br>

                For 2016, our Rider of the Year award rollout will once again be an exclusively digital happening. Each weekday from Monday, January 4th until Monday January 25th, SNOWBOARDER will highlight a different rider’s achievement, culminating with the ultimate praise of naming our 2016 Rider of the Year.<br><br>
